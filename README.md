# Dice-Rolling-Game

This is a simple dice-rolling game. You can roll two dice simultaneously with just one click of the "Roll Dice" button. 🎲

The dice will display two different numbers (or the same number), and the screen will show the product of both numbers. It's all about your luck!

You can roll the dice as many times as you want. It’s a game to play when you’re bored and have nothing else to do. 🕹️ When you're done, you can click the **End Game** button and find something else to do. 😄
